# MGRSConverter
Converts between Lat/Lon and MGRS Coordinates

The math and theory for the conversions between Latitude/Longitude, UTM, and MGRS was adapted from code provided by https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-utm-mgrs.html
The first unpublished iteration of this was a simple translation of the JavaScript provided to Swift.
Subsequent iterations have evolved into packaging the math within into a more useable iOS interface.

The next branch of this project will focus on offline map areas.
